# Introduction

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v1.0.2-orange)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-structured-query-search-suggestions) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

react-structured-query-search-suggestions is a javascript library that provides autocomplete search queries with dynamic/static suggestions.
This was inspired by [visualsearch](http://documentcloud.github.io/visualsearch), [react-structured-filter](https://github.com/SummitRoute/react-structured-filter) and [react-structured-query-search](https://github.com/kevalbhatt/react-structured-query-search).
>This plugin is written on top of [react-structured-filter](https://github.com/SummitRoute/react-structured-filter), which has been revamped to add React 16 support and the existing code has been overriden to support New features.

You can use all the [react-typeahead](https://github.com/fmoo/react-typeahead), [react-structured-filter](https://github.com/SummitRoute/react-structured-filter)  API(options) as they are.
